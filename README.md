# Paid Family & Medical Leave Prototype

This prototype is being built by 18F, in partnership with the Department of Labor's Women's Bureau. Our goal is to provide a simple front end, and some guidance on potential back-end structures, so that any jurisdiction with a Paid Family Medical Leave Program can easily implement the program. Please check out the [current prototype](https://pages.18f.gov/Paid-Leave-Prototype/)

## Development
Current development is in the [18f-pages branch](https://github.com/18F/Paid-Leave-Prototype/tree/18f-pages).
