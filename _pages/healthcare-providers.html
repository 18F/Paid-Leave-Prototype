      <h1>Healthcare providers</h1>
      <p>Healthcare providers have a critical role to play in the filing and processing of paid family medical leave benefits. Namely, healthcare providers are required to provide supplemental information to be used in the evaluation of someone&rsquo;s claim for benefits.</p>
      <h2>Providing supplemental information</h2>
      <p>Healthcare providers have two options for providing information about their patients. First, healthcare providers can print or request a copy of the supplemental information form. See the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/forms-and-publications">forms and publications</a> page of this website.</p>
      <p>Second, healthcare providers can provide supplemental information through this website itself. All claimants are given a verification code to pass along to their healthcare provider after filing a claim for benefits online. Healthcare providers then <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/claims/verify">sign in to the PFML website to provide supplemental information</a>. This process is more fully explained on the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/claims/how-it-works">how it works</a> page.</p>
      <h2>Our review process</h2>
      <p>[State name] takes the following into account when reviewing this information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The quality, accuracy, and timeliness of medical certifications. </li>
        <li>The diagnosis, International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes, and estimated recovery dates.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>[State name] cross-references the information provided by the person filing the claim with the information provided by healthcare providers. When an estimated recovery date for a specific diagnosis is materially more than what normally would be expected, [State name] reach out to the implicated parties for additional information. In special circumstances, [State name] may send the person filing for benefits to an independent medical examiner for a second opinion regarding their ability to perform their regular and customary work.
      <h2>Injury</h2>
      <p>If your patient has an industrial related illness or injury, please have the patient contact his/her employer regarding workers&rsquo; compensation benefits.</p>
